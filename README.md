# WaterQualityPrediction__AICTE
A machine learning project that predicts whether water is safe for use by analyzing chemical parameters such as Ammonium (NH₄⁺), Nitrate (NO₃⁻), Nitrite (NO₂⁻), Phosphate (PO₄³⁻), Sulfate (SO₄²⁻), Chloride (Cl⁻), Dissolved Oxygen (O₂), BOD (BSK5), and Suspended Solids. These features help identify pollution, oxygen depletion, and contamination risk
