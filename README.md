# WaterQualityPrediction__AICTE
A machine learning project that predicts whether water is safe for use by analyzing chemical parameters such as Ammonium (NH₄⁺), Nitrate (NO₃⁻), Nitrite (NO₂⁻), Phosphate (PO₄³⁻), Sulfate (SO₄²⁻), Chloride (Cl⁻), Dissolved Oxygen (O₂), BOD (BSK5), and Suspended Solids. These features help identify pollution, oxygen depletion, and contamination risk


**Technologies Used
Python 3.12
Pandas, NumPy – Data handling
Scikit-learn – Machine learning model and evaluation
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook – Interactive experimentation
Predicted Water Quality Parameters


**The model predicts multiple water quality parameters such as:
NH4
BOD5 (BSK5)
Colloids
O2, NO3, NO2, SO4, PO4 and
CL
Model Performance


**The model was evaluated using:
R² Score
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Performance was acceptable across all parameters
